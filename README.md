What happens if I remove React StrictMode?

Based on the React documentation, removing StrictMode would remove React's development-time checks and warnings that help you identify potential problems in your application. Here are the key implications of removing StrictMode:

1. **Loss of Double-Rendering Detection**: StrictMode intentionally double-renders components in development to help detect side effects in rendering. Without it, you might miss bugs related to impure rendering.

2. **Missing Deprecation Warnings**: You won't get warnings about using deprecated React features or APIs that might break in future versions.

3. **Reduced Bug Detection**: StrictMode helps identify several common bugs by:
   - Detecting accidental side effects in render phase
   - Warning about legacy string refs
   - Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage
   - Detecting unexpected side effects in constructor
   - Detecting legacy context API usage

Here's how your code would look without StrictMode:

```typescript:src/main.tsx
// ... existing code ...

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!).render(
  <App />
);
```

While your application will still work without StrictMode, it's generally recommended to keep it enabled, especially during development, as it helps maintain better code quality and catches potential issues early. StrictMode is a development-only feature and doesn't impact the production build, so there's usually no performance benefit to removing it.
